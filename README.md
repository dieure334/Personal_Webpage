# Personal Webpage

__OVERVIEW__

This is a webpage that I created as a final project for a website development class in college. The webpage is made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and contains various pieces of information of me such as my education and work experience. It also contains some older projects that I made when I first began studying Computer Science in high school.

As part of the assignment that this webpage was intended for, I was instructed to submit this using my GitHub username along the .github.io URL ending, hence the strange repository name. 

If you would like to see how the webpage appears on a normal browser, click on the link below:
