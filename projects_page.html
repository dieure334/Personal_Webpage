                            This was the first coding project that I made back in high school.
                            It is a simple maze game made in Scratch. Although not
                            technically a high-level programming language, it was one
                            of my first exposures to programming and basic programming
                            topics.

                            This was an Android app that I created in high school. It is
                            a basic coloring app designed for Android devices. How it works is
                            that you would start off with a blank canvas on the screen and choose
                            your color and pen size. The touchscreen feature of the device would
                            allow you to draw on the screen. In addition to this, there were other
                            features included such as the ability to erase and clear the canvas.

                            Unfortunately, this project was lost as I had created it using an account
                            that used my high school email address. Once I graduated high school, the 
                            account was deleted, along with all projects I made using the account. I do 
                            have some screenshots and a single video I took of the program working, but 
                            the actual code is lost.

                            This was a project I created with a friend for a 
                            Computer Science class during my Senior year of high
                            school. This program uses HTML with JavaScript along
                            with A-Frame to create a 3D VR environment. The program
                            allows the user to "shoot" projectiles within the
                            environment via click of the mouse. The project is 
                            originally meant to be compatible with Google Cardboard
                            but works just as well on a computer. It also includes 
                            royalty-free music from Bensound.

                            This was a group project that I worked on with 3 other members during my
                            time at community college. It is a simple calcuator written in Assembly
                            that can only do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

                            This was a group project I worked on when studying Software Development
                            during the Summer 2022 term at CSU East Bay. Due to time constraints
                            caused by the much shorter semester, the project was left unfinished.
                            The idea was to create a game of BlackJack using Java that also utilized
                            some local area network features.
