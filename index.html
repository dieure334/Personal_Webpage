                Hello, my name is Diego and welcome to my webpage. I am currently
                a senior undergraduate studying Computer Science at California
                State University, East Bay located in Hayward, CA. During my
                time studying Computer Science, which spans back to my Senior
                year of high school, I have studied various programming langauges
                and topics such as software development and network security. 
            </p>
    
            <p class="intro">
                Within this website, you will find information about myself as well as 
                some work that I have done over the years while studying Computer Science.

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p class="intro">
                I've always been interested in computers at a young age, but was never
                really invested in studying Computer Science until my senior year of
                high school. It was then that I decided to learn programming, but little
                did I know that there are so many fields within Computer Science that I did
                not know which to focus my attention on. For now, I try to learn a little
                bit of everything.
            </p>

            <p class="intro">
                In addition to studying Computer Science, my hobbies mainly revolve
                around playing video games. In my free time, I collect old video game
                consoles as I am fascinated with old technology. I also have an interest
                in photography, oil pastel painting, and baking. But for the most part,
                in my free time, I usually play video games. My current interest is
                playing Nintendo Switch, since I can pretty much take it wherever I
                go, including my college campus.
